1. WEB SITE

Please visit our web site at http://www.sourceinsight.com for the latest product 
information, pricing, and maintenance releases. Technical questions can be addressed
to support@sourceinsight.com .


2. TRIAL VERSION 

The Source Insight Trial Version is a fully functional version which will 
run for approximately 30 days. We welcome you to use the trial version to see 
how well Source Insight works for you. You can get the trial version at our 
web site: www.sourceinsight.com. If you purchase a license, you will 
receive a serial number that unlocks and removes the trial period limitation.

Serial Number: If you are using the Trial version, you can leave the serial number 
box blank and click the TRY button to run the Trial version.


3. INSTALLATION

You will need the SERIAL NUMBER from the CD case when you install 
Source Insight. If you purchased a Download version, then the serial number 
was emailed to you.

If you are using the Trial version, you can leave the serial number box blank 
and click the TRY button.


4. WINDOWS SETUP

You should run the setup program from any user
that has permissions to install software and modify the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 
registry hive. You do not need to have full Administration permissions to install 
Source Insight. The default "Power User" type will work fine.

Windows 7 and Vista: We recommend using "Run As Administrator" when launching the 
setup program.

Once installed Source Insight will appear in the "All Users" program group. 
Any user may access and run the program after it is installed.

User Data Directories: Source Insight creates a "Source Insight" folder within 
the "My Documents" folder for each logged in user that runs Source Insight. 


5. DUAL-BOOT SYSTEMS

If you have a dual-boot system, you will have to install Source Insight 
separately under each OS. However, you should install Source Insight into 
the same location on your disk.

If you are installing a maintenance release, please refer to the changes.txt 
file to read about changes and new features.


6. PERFORMANCE ISSUES

There are several options in Source Insight that can affect performance. 
Please see "Performance Tuning" in the User Manual or online help.
